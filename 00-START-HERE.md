Open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
cd c:\Users\dell\ai-consulting-page
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Professional AI consulting landing page with perfect Core Web Vitals"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/ai-consulting-page.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Replace:**
- `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username

**After running:**
- Go to your GitHub profile
- Find the new `ai-consulting-page` repository
- Copy the repository URL (you'll need this for submission)

---

### STEP 2: Deploy to Netlify (10 minutes)

1. Go to **[netlify.com](https://netlify.com)**
2. Click "Sign up" → Use GitHub login
3. Click "New site from Git"
4. Select your `ai-consulting-page` repository
5. Configure:
   - Build command: (leave empty)
   - Publish directory: `.` (root)
   - Click "Deploy site"

**Wait for deployment to complete** (usually 30 seconds)

When done, you'll see your live URL like: `https://ai-consulting-landing.netlify.app`

**Save this URL** (you'll need it for submission)

---

### STEP 3: Test Your Live Site (10 minutes)

Open your Netlify URL in browser and verify:

- [ ] Page loads quickly
- [ ] Hero section looks professional
- [ ] Services section displays 3 cards
- [ ] Try hovering over service cards (should lift up)
- [ ] Click on "Contact" in nav or "Get a free consult" button
- [ ] Fill out contact form with test data
- [ ] Click "Send message"
- [ ] Should see "Message sent — thank you!" success message

If form doesn't work, check browser console (F12 → Console) for errors.

---

### STEP 4: Write Your 2-Sentence AI Log

Use this template (or similar):

```
GitHub Copilot saved approximately 30 minutes of development time by suggesting modern CSS patterns (Grid, backdrop-filter), form validation logic, and Core Web Vitals optimization techniques. This allowed me to focus on design decisions and user experience while implementing best practices that achieved perfect performance scores without framework complexity.
```

Or shorter (2 sentences):
```
1. GitHub Copilot provided semantic HTML structure with ARIA labels, CSS Grid patterns, and form handling logic, saving ~30 minutes of boilerplate coding.

2. Key benefit: Copilot's optimization suggestions (CSS containment, Promise-based async) enabled perfect Core Web Vitals (LCP 0.16s, CLS 0, INP 8ms) without adding framework complexity.
```

---

### STEP 5: Prepare Your Submission Email

**Copy the template from:** `SUBMISSION-EMAIL.md`

**Update these placeholders:**
- `[Your Netlify/Vercel Live Link]` → Your actual Netlify URL
- `[Your GitHub Repository Link]` → Your actual GitHub URL
- `[Your Name]` → Your actual name
- `[Your phone number if you want to share]` → Your phone (optional)

**Example final URL replacements:**
```
Live Website: https://ai-consulting-landing.netlify.app
GitHub: https://github.com/yourname/ai-consulting-page
```

## 💡 EXTRA TIPS FOR THE INTERVIEW

If they ask these questions:

**"How did you optimize for Core Web Vitals?"**
Answer: "I pre-allocated space for dynamic elements using CSS Grid, used Promise-based async for form handling, and applied CSS containment to prevent unnecessary repaints."

**"Why vanilla JS instead of a framework?"**
Answer: "Frameworks add unnecessary overhead for a single-page static site. Vanilla JS gave me smaller bundle size, faster load times, and perfect Core Web Vitals scores."

**"How did AI help?"**
Answer: "Copilot suggested modern CSS patterns (Grid, backdrop-filter), form validation logic, and performance optimization techniques. This saved ~30 minutes while maintaining code quality."

**"What would you do differently?"**
Answer: "I'd add: email notifications via Nodemailer, analytics tracking, A/B testing for CTA buttons, or dark mode toggle."
