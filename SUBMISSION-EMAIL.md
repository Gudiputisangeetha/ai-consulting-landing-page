## THE AI EDGE: GitHub Copilot Usage

**AI Tool Used:** GitHub Copilot

**Time Saved:** Approximately 30 minutes

**How it Saved Time:**
1. **HTML Structure:** Copilot suggested semantic HTML with ARIA labels and form validation (5 min saved)
2. **CSS Optimization:** Auto-completed modern CSS patterns (Grid, backdrop-filter, responsive breakpoints) (10 min saved)
3. **JavaScript:** Provided form handling logic with Promise-based async/await patterns (8 min saved)
4. **Performance:** Suggested Core Web Vitals optimization techniques like CSS containment and layout shift prevention (7 min saved)

**Key Benefit:** Copilot allowed me to focus on design decisions and user experience rather than boilerplate code, enabling the implementation of performance best practices that achieved perfect Core Web Vitals scores without framework complexity.
